# Local Development

The following assumes the use of `node@>=10`. 

### Uninstall `node` if you don't use `n` yet, then install n:
`$ curl -L https://git.io/n-install | bash`

A new latest node is installed, but this package requires version 10: `$ n 10.16.0`

Type: `$ n` to change npm, then select which version.
